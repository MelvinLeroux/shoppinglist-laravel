# ShoppingList Laravel

This is my second project in Laravel and the first one that uses an API and in a SPA form.

This is an application that allows you to create a shopping list, you can add items and categories, you can link an item to a category.
You can also edit or remove an item and remove a category.
I used Insomnia  to interact, design, debug and test the API.
